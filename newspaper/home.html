        <p>
          Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina says that the entire world is currently experiencing a dollar crisis and its effects aren’t limited to Bangladesh.

         “The dollar crisis is worldwide, not just in Bangladesh,” the prime minister said during a press briefing at her official residence, Ganabhaban, on Monday.

         “First there was the COVID pandemic, then the Ukraine-Russia war, and then, along with the war came sanctions and counter-sanctions. As a result, inflation has spiked worldwide. Transportation and production costs have gone up. This is why the entire world is suffering from a dollar crisis.”

         During the pandemic, imports and exports were hampered and travel abroad was halted, which meant that Bangladesh had low costs and the country was able to build up reserves, the prime minister said.

         “When economies reopened, dollars were spent, which is typical. In addition, we are providing power to the people, gas, we are conducting development work, we are investing, production is rising, so the pressure on the dollar is natural.</p>

        <p>Dhaka has topped the list of cities around the world with the worst air quality this morning.Dhaka, formerly known as Dacca, is the capital city of Bangladesh. It holds the title of not only being the largest city in the country, but being the 9th largest city worldwide. It also ranks at 6th place out of the most populous cities in the world, with just under 9 million people living within the city’s limits. Due to these reasons, as well as being the economic hub of the whole country, Dhaka is subject to some fairly bad pollution levels annually, with only brief periods of respite, that despite being lower still hold some relatively high numbers of pollution readings, making its air harmful to breathe year-round..</p>

        <p>Bangladesh received an infamous and inappropriate coverage in the global press that the country was planning to use Indian rupee or Chinese renminbi for international payment settlements. In other words, the argument was that the Bangladesh Bank, the country's central bank, would be diversifying its foreign exchange reserves away from the US dollar to include more renminbi and rupee instead. It is infamous and inappropriate because the country's forex reserves continue to consist mostly of the US dollar-denominated assets.Bangladesh has experienced persistent and increasing bilateral trade imbalances against both China and India over the past decade, particularly since July 1, 2021. Note that most of the country's bilateral trades with China and India are invoiced in US dollars, and so the resultant international payment obligations are settled in US dollars. The idea of settling accrued payment obligations using either the Indian rupee or the renminbi instead of the US dollar is without substance, because their payment settlement is predetermined. In addition, the prevailing forex market really doesn't have access to those alternative currencies at any reasonable costs.</p>

        <p>If the process of producing muslin, revived through government research in 2021, cannot be commercialised, the success will be under question, said Textiles and Jute Minister Golam Dastagir Gazi yesterday. It took about seven months to make a muslin sari of medium quality and so its price is very high, beyond the purchasing power of the masses, he said.

          If the masses cannot purchase muslin, questions will arise. Therefore, through commercial production, muslin should be kept within the purchasing power of common people. Only then will the research be fully successful, he said.</p>
